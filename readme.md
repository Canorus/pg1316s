# mikefive, a Kailh PG1316S keyboard

Welcome to my repo about my mikefive keyboard! 

It's wireless and five millimeters thick. Here's a picture of it:

The keyboard above is completely custom designed around Kailh PG1316S switches. 
These switches I got unexpectedly offered by Kailh when ordering other stuff. 
They do not seem to be on shelves yet to buy. Read on to learn more.

## Where are the files?!

Sorry. You won't find files or info to build the keyboard yourself here, yet. 

You will only find the ZMK config files for the custom shield, my current keymap, and a custom json for [ZMK Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/). 
Most commits here will probably be me updating my keymap :)

Maybe I was a fool to show it to the world already, while I only built a single prototype. 
Because, like with most first prototypes, I found stuff that needs to be improved before other people start building. 
Next to that, another unexpected opportunity arose, which I will definitly scream from the rooftops about when it's more concrete...

I will update this page when there is news, and post on r/ergomechkeyboards too.

### 2024-04-28 
After completing the build on Wednesday 24th of April and working with it for a couple days, I decided to make a post on r/ergomechkeyboards. 
It became a really long write-up, as I wanted to share as many details as possible.
Thank you all for your flattering replies! They really gave me energy to continue the project and make sure the keyboard will eventually get in the hands of people that want it.
