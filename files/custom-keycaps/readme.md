# Custom Keycaps: READ ME FIRST!

I STRONGLY ADVICE NOT TO HAVE THESE FILES PRINTED AT A COMMERCIAL PRINT SERVICE!

I have succesfully printed these keycaps on MY OWN resin and FDM printer at work. I tuned all dimensions for a good fit using MY OWN printers. After tuning them to perfection I ordered them at JLC and received keycaps with a very bad finish and fit, even different fits between individual keycaps JLC delivered.

Especialy for resin printing there are many variables influencing the dimensions of the print: slicing orientation and settings, material properties, washing time, abrasive post processing, and who know what more. Since these keycaps require very precise dimensions to have a tight fit ont the switch without rattle but not too tight to prevent the switch from getting stuck, external resin printing is therefor far from ideal.

# Well, what should I do with these files then?

Ideally, print them yourself. Start with a couple and tweak the scale or even individual part dimensions to get a better fit.

# What if I don't have a printer?
MJF printing should be a better option as all of those machines are from the same manufacturer (HP) and use proprietary materials and software. They are know to produce very repeatable part dimensions from wherever you have them printed. If you can live with the slightly grainy and grippy texture, I would advise going with MJF.
