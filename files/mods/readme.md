I still need to write this is more detail, but in short:

The papermod1 is just a rectangular piece of paper that eliminates the rattle between PG1316S switch and stock keycap. This makes the switch feel more robust and silent. Just put is under the keycap as shown in the image.

Papermod1 is more silent but still has a hard bottom out. The papermod2 prevents the hard bottom out by reducing stroke by the height of 2 pieces of paper (about 0.2mm) attached to the sides of papermod 1. Both bottom out and sound are softer.

Try both for yourself and find out! The video shows how to fold papermod2 and demonstrates the difference in sound between (1) stock, (2) papermod1 and (3) papermod2.

There is a PDF with cutting template for both, and the source InkScape file, and a DXF of a separete papermod2 piece if you have a lasercutter and hand.

Curious for your experience!
