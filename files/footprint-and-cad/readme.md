This space will get some more info about footprints later. 

Note:
I have had good experience with using 0.8mm vias in the switch contact pads and 0.6mm vias in the switch mounting pads. I have the feeling they are easier sucked down to the PCB. 
Some solderpaste will leak onto your hotplate if you put big vias in the pads, and I was warned about possible damage to the hotplate, but so far it seems easy to clean on my Miniware MHP30 and PCB with IPA.
The original specsheet also shows holes in the pads, which might be for a reason. On mikefive I skipped these vias to get a fully contact free bottom, which is also worth something.
